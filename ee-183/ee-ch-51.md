# Basics
- Mass of electron = $9.11\times 10^{-31}$kg
- Change of electron = $1.6\times 10^{-19}$C
- Diameter of atom = $10^{-10}$m
- Diameter of nucleus = $10^{-15}$m

# Bohr Model
## Postulates:
1. massive positively charged nucleus
2. centrifugal force = electrostatic force
3. permitted energy levels: $mvr=\frac{nh}{2\pi}$
4. radiate energy in orbital jumps: $\Delta E=hf$
## Calculations
All formulae derive from these two:
1. $\frac{mv^2}{r} = \frac{Ze^2}{4\pi \epsilon_0  r^2}$
2. $mvr=\frac{nh}{2\pi}$

Derive these:
- $r$
- $v$
- $f = \frac{v}{2\pi r}$
- $E_k = \frac{1}{2}mv^2$
- $E_p = V\times (-e)$, $V = \frac{Ze^2}{4\pi \epsilon_0 r}$
- $E_t=E_p+E_k$

# Normal, Excited, Ionized Atom
**Normal:** When the electrons are in their respective orbits (At room temperature)\
**Excited:** When the electron(s) are in higher orbits, but not completely removed (spark/heat)\
**Ionized:** When the electron(s) are in higher orbits completely removed (spark/heat)
- Electrons does not reamin excited for longer that $10^{-8}$s
- Electrons return to normal state from excited state in several jumps, thereby emitting radiations of different frequencies

# Energy Level for H atom
- $E_n = \frac{-13.6}{n^2} eV$
