# Basics
- Mass of electron = $9.11\times 10^{-31}$ kg
- Change of electron = $1.6\times 10^{-19}$ C
- Diameter of atom = $10^{-10}$ m
- Diameter of nucleus = $10^{-15}$ m

# Bohr Model
## Postulates
1. Massive positively charged nucleus
2. Centrifugal force = electrostatic force
3. Permitted energy levels: $mvr=\frac{nh}{2\pi}$
4. Radiate energy in orbital jumps: $\Delta E=hf$
## Calculations
All formulae derive from these two:
1. $\frac{mv^2}{r} = \frac{Ze^2}{4\pi \epsilon_0  r^2}$
2. $mvr=\frac{nh}{2\pi}$

Derive these:
- $r$
- $v$
- $f = \frac{v}{2\pi r}$
- $E_k = \frac{1}{2}mv^2$
- $E_p = V\times (-e)$, $V = \frac{Ze^2}{4\pi \epsilon_0 r}$
- $E_t=E_p+E_k$

# Normal, Excited, Ionized Atom
1. **Normal:** When the electrons are in their respective orbits (At room temperature)
1. **Excited:** When the electron(s) are in higher orbits, but not completely removed (spark/heat)
1. **Ionized:** When the electron(s) are in higher orbits completely removed (spark/heat)


- Electrons does not reamin excited for longer that $10^{-8}$ s
- Electrons return to normal state from excited state in several jumps, thereby emitting radiations of different frequencies

# Energy Level for H atom

# Orbital/Azimuthal Quantum Number
- orbit = shell
- Each orbit/shell has suborbit/subshells.
- Orbital/Azimuthal Quantum Number: $0\leq l\leq n-1$
- Number of subshells of shell - $n$ is $n$.

# Electron Configuration of Atom
- Each shell can hold maximum $2n^2$ electrons
- Each subshell can hold maximum $2(2l+1)$ electrons

# Magnetic Quantum Number
- $m\space\epsilon\space\{-l\space... \space0\space... \space l\}$
- $m$ determines number of orbitals/sub-subshells
- Number of orbitals = $2l+1$
- Each orbital can hold maximum $2$ electrons

# Spin Quantum Number
- $s\space\epsilon\space \{\frac{1}{2},-\frac{1}{2}\}$

# Pauli's Exclusion Principle
- No two electrons can have the same set of values for its four quantum number $n$, $l$, $m$ and $s$

- When atoms are far apart they don't form bands
- When atoms are very close, the electrons of different atoms fill up the same energy level, which violates Pauli's Exclusion Principle. So, the energy levels split into bands
- Energy level splits into N bands, if there are N atoms in the crystal
- At first outer shells are splitted. Then as the atoms get closer, inner shells are also splitted.

# Spacing Between Energy Levels of a Band
- If there are $N$ atoms in a cristal, and width of energy band is $x\space eV$, spacing between energy levels of the same band = $\frac{x}{N}eV$

**(a) Isolated Li atom:**
- First shell:\
  Capacity: 2 electrons\
  Filled: 2  electrons(Completely filled)
- Second shell:\
  Capacity: 2 electrons\
  Filled: 1 electrons (Not completely filled)

**(b) Li atom in crystal:**\
Lets say there are 100 atoms in a Li Crystal.
- First band:\
  Number of energy levels: 100\
  Capacity: 200 electrons
  Filled: 200 electrons (Completely filled)
- Second band:\
  Number of energy levels: 100\
  Capacity: 200 electrons
  Filled: 100 electrons (Not completely filled)
