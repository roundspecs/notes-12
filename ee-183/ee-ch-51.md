# Basics
- Mass of electron = 9.11x10^-31kg
- Change of electron = 1.6x10^-19C
- Diameter of atom = 10^-10m
- Diameter of nucleus = 10^-15m

# Bohr Model
## Postulates:
    1. massive positively charged nucleus
    2. centrifugal force = electrostatic force
    3. permitted energy levels: mvr=nh/2pi
    4. radiate energy in orbital jumps: delE=hf
## Calculations
All formulae derive from these two:
    1. (mv^2)/r = (Ze^2)/(4pi x epsilon x r^2)
    2. mvr=nh/2pi
Derive these:
    - r
    - v
    - f = v/(2pi*r)
    - K.E = 1/2 * mv^2
    - P.E = Vx(-e), V = Ze^2 / (4pi x epsilon x r)
    - T.E = P.E + K.E

# Normal, Excited, Ionized Atom
**Normal:** When the electrons are in their respective orbits (At room temperature)
**Excited:** When the electron(s) are in higher orbits, but not completely removed (spark/heat)
**Ionized:** When the electron(s) are in higher orbits completely removed (spark/heat)
- Electrons does not reamin excited for longer that 10^-8s
- Electrons return to normal state from excited state in several jumps, thereby emitting radiations of different frequencies

# Energy Level for H atom
- E(n) = -13.6/n^2 eV
