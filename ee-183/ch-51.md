- Charge of electron, $e$: `Electromagnetic 3`

# Basics
- Mass of electron = $9.11\times 10^{-31}$ kg
- Change of electron = $1.6\times 10^{-19}$ C
- Diameter of atom = $10^{-10}$ m
- Diameter of nucleus = $10^{-15}$ m

# Bohr Model
## Postulates
1. Massive positively charged nucleus
2. Centrifugal force = electrostatic force
3. Permitted energy levels: $mvr=\frac{nh}{2\pi}$
4. Radiate energy in orbital jumps: $\Delta E=hf$
## Calculations
All formulae derive from these two:
1. $\frac{mv^2}{r} = \frac{Ze^2}{4\pi \epsilon_0  r^2}$
2. $mvr=\frac{nh}{2\pi}$

Derive these:
- $r$
- $v$
- $f = \frac{v}{2\pi r}$
- $E_k = \frac{1}{2}mv^2$
- $E_p = V\times (-e)$, $V = \frac{Ze^2}{4\pi \epsilon_0 r}$
- $E_t=E_p+E_k$

# Normal, Excited, Ionized Atom
1. **Normal:** When the electrons are in their respective orbits (At room temperature)
1. **Excited:** When the electron(s) are in higher orbits, but not completely removed (spark/heat)
1. **Ionized:** When the electron(s) are in higher orbits completely removed (spark/heat)


- Electrons does not reamin excited for longer that $10^{-8}$ s
- Electrons return to normal state from excited state in several jumps, thereby emitting radiations of different frequencies

# Orbital/Azimuthal Quantum Number
- orbit = shell
- Each orbit/shell has suborbit/subshells.
- Orbital/Azimuthal Quantum Number: $0\leq l\leq n-1$
- Number of subshells of shell - $n$ is $n$.

# Electron Configuration of Atom
- Each shell can hold maximum $2n^2$ electrons
- Each subshell can hold maximum $2(2l+1)$ electrons

# Magnetic Quantum Number
- $m\space\epsilon\space\{-l\space... \space0\space... \space l\}$
- $m$ determines number of orbitals/sub-subshells
- Number of orbitals = $2l+1$
- Each orbital can hold maximum $2$ electrons

# Spin Quantum Number
- $s\space\epsilon\space \{\frac{1}{2},-\frac{1}{2}\}$

# Pauli's Exclusion Principle
- No two electrons can have the same set of values for its four quantum number $n$, $l$, $m$ and $s$

# Energy Band in Solids

- [Khanacademy - Semiconductors](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL2ub1_oKCn7ogaMtdB2RumlIYqNeXf_oX)
- When atoms are far apart they don't form bands
- When atoms are very close, the electrons of different atoms fill up the same energy level, which violates Pauli's Exclusion Principle. So, the energy levels split into bands
- Energy level splits into N bands, if there are N atoms in the crystal
- At first outer shells are splitted. Then as the atoms get closer, inner shells are also splitted.

# Spacing Between Energy Levels of a Band
- If there are $N$ atoms in a cristal, and width of energy band is $x\space eV$, spacing between energy levels of the same band = $\frac{x}{N}eV$

# Energy Bands in Lithium and their Occupancy
![Alt text](<Energy band in Li atom.png>)
**(a) Isolated Li atom:**
- First shell:\
  Capacity: 2 electrons\
  Filled: 2  electrons(Completely filled)
- Second shell:\
  Capacity: 2 electrons\
  Filled: 1 electrons (Not completely filled)

**(b) Li atom in crystal:**\
Lets say there are 100 atoms in a Li Crystal.
- First band:\
  Number of energy levels: 100\
  Capacity: 200 electrons
  Filled: 200 electrons (Completely filled)
- Second band:\
  Number of energy levels: 100\
  Capacity: 200 electrons
  Filled: 100 electrons (Not completely filled)

# Valence and Conduction Band
**Valence Band:**\
The band of energy occupied by the valence electrons is called the valence band.
- It may be completely filled or partially filled with electrons but never empty.
- Holes are in valence band
- Holes are filled by electrons in valence band which move from adjacent atoms without passing through the forbidden energy gap.

**Conduction Band:**\
The next higher permitted energy band is called the conduction band
- May either be empty or partially filled with electrons
- In conduction band, electrons can move freely and hence are known as conduction electrons.
- An electron in the conduction band can jump to an adjacent
conduction band more readily than it can jump back to the valence band from where it had come
earlier.
  
**Forbidden Gap:**\
The gap between these two bands is known as the forbidden energy gap.

- If a valence electron happens to absorb enough energy, it jumps across the forbidden energy gap and
enters the conduction band
- Important distinction between electron flow and hole flow: Electrons flow in conduction band, holes flow in valence band
- Although holes flow with ease, they experience more opposition than electron flow in the conduction band

**Key points:**
1. conduction electrons are found in and freely flow in the conduction band
2. holes exist in and flow in the valence band
3. conduction electrons move almost twice as fast as the holes

# Insulators, Conductors and Semiconductors
![Insulators, Conductors and Semiconductors](<Insulators, Conductors and Semiconductors.png>)
## Insulators
- Have a full valence band
- Have an empty conduction band
- Have a large energy gap (of several eV) between them
- At ordinary temperatures, the probability of electrons of valence band to cross the forbidden gap and become available in conduction band, by gaining energy is slight
- Increase in temperature enables some
electrons to go to the conduction band which fact accounts for
the negative resistance-temperature coefficient of insulators.
## Conductors
- Have overlapping valence and conduction bands
- A point worth noting is that in the absence of forbidden energy gap in good conductors, there is no structure to establish holes. The total current in such conductors is simply a flow of electrons
## Semi-conductor
- Have almost an empty conduction band (empty at $0K$)
- Have almost filled valence band
- Very narrow energy gap
- Conductivity of semiconductors increases with temperature
- Moreover, such departing electrons leave behind positive holes in the valence band. Hence, semiconductor current is the sum of electron and hole currents flowing in opposite directions.

# Atomic Binding in Semiconductors
- Both Si, Ge are tetravalent
- Each atom is surrounded by 4 atoms forming a tetrahedral crystal

- An intrinsic semiconductor is one which is made of the semiconductor material in its extremely pure form.
- In pure semiconductors kept in the dark, thermally-generated charge carriers are the only means of conduction.
- $n_i = N e^{\frac{−E_g}{2kT}}$
  - $n_i$ = intrinsic carrier density
  - $N$ = constant for a given semiconductor
  - $E_g$ = band gap energy (in Joules)
  - $k$ = Boltzmann’s constant
  - $T$ = Temperature (in K)
