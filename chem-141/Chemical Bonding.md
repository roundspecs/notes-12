# Chemical Bonding
## Definition
A chemical bond is defined as a **force** that acts between two
or more atoms to hold them together as a stable molecule
## Why atoms combine
1. Attractive force between nucleus of one atom and electrons of the other
2. To form stable octet structure of the noble gases
## How atoms combine
1. Transfer of electrons (Ionic Bond)
2. Sharing of electron pairs
	1. One electron from each (Covalent Bond)
	2. Both electrons from one (Coordinate Bond)
## Classification
- Strong Bonds
	- Ionic
	- Covalent
	- Coordinate
	- Metallic
- Weak Bonds
	- Hydrogen Bond
	- Van der Waals Bond

# Valence Electrons
## Definition
Electrons in the outermost energy level, that take part in chemical bonding
>[!info] Valence electron = Bonding electron + Non-bonding electron
## Classification
### Bonding Electrons
Valence electrons that are involved in bond formation
### Non-bonding Electrons
Valence electrons that are still available for bond formation
# Ionic Bond
***AKA*** Electrovalent bond
