# Chemical Bonding
## Definition
A chemical bond is defined as a **force** that acts between two
or more atoms to hold them together as a stable molecule
## Why atoms combine
1. Attractive force between nucleus of one atom and electrons of the other
2. To form stable octet structure of the noble gases
## How atoms combine
1. Transfer of electrons (Ionic Bond)
2. Sharing of electron pairs
	1. One electron from each (Covalent Bond)
	2. Both electrons from one (Coordinate Bond)
## Classification
- Strong Bonds
	- Ionic
	- Covalent
	- Coordinate
	- Metallic
- Weak Bonds
	- Hydrogen Bond
	- Van der Waals Bond

# Valence Electrons
## Definition
Electrons in the outermost energy level, that take part in chemical bonding
>[!info] Valence electron = Bonding electron + Non-bonding electron
## Classification
### Bonding Electrons
Valence electrons that are involved in bond formation
### Non-bonding Electrons
Valence electrons that are still available for bond formation
# Ionic Bond
## Definition
Electrostatic attraction force between atoms due to transfer of electrons
> [!info] A.k.a. Electrovalent bond
## Conditions of Bond Formation
1. **Number of valence electrons**
	- A should posses 1, 2 or 3 electrons
	- B should posses 5, 6 or 7 electrons
1. **Difference of electronegativities**
	- $\lvert\chi(A)-\chi(B)\rvert\geq2$
1. **Net lowering of energy**
	- Ionization energy: required to ionize cation
	- Electron affinity: released to form anion
	- Lattice energy: released by electrostatic attraction
	- Total released energy (= IE + EA + LE) should be positive
## Factors
1. Ionization Energy $\downarrow$
2. Electron Affinity $\uparrow$
3. Lattice Energy $\uparrow$
	- Atomic size $\downarrow$
	- Charge of atoms $\uparrow$
## Characteristics
1. **Solid at room temperature**
	- Strong electrostatic force
	- Therefore, locked in their position in lattice
	- Therefore, lack the freedom of movement
1. **High melting point**
	- Same as above
1. **Hard and brittle**
	- Same as above
	- And this:	![[Pasted image 20230828161940.png]]
1. **Soluble in water**
	- Polar water molecules pull the ions apart
	- Therefore, ions separate![[Pasted image 20230828162244.png]]
1. **Electric conductor**
	- Solid state -> Poor conductor
	- Molten/Soluble sate -> Good conductor
1. **Doesn't exhibit isomerism**
	- They don't have directional bond
1. **Fast reaction**
	- Reaction between ions are fast
# Covalent Bond
## Condition of Bond Formation
1. **Number of valence electrons**
	- A or B must be H or have 5,6, or 7 electrons
1. **Equal electronegativities**
	- $\chi(A)\approx\chi(B)$
1. **Equal electron sharing**
	- Electrons affinities must be similar or equal
	- Equal electron affinity is only possible if both A and B are same
## Characteristics
 1. **Gas, Liquid or Soft solid at room temperature** 
	- Covalent bond firmly hold the atoms together, but the molecules are hold together by weak Van der Waals force
1. **Low melting and boiling point**
	- Same as above
1. **Neither hard nor brittle**
	- Same as above
1. **Soluble in organic solvents**
	- Kinetic energy of the solvent easily breaks the weak inter-molecular force
1. **Electric nonconductor**
	- They don't have any ions
1. **Exhibits Isomerism**
	- They have directional bonds
1. **Slow reaction**
	- There are no ions to make it fast
# Polarity of Bonds
## Periodic Trends![[Pasted image 20230828202654.png]]
## Electronegativities![[Pasted image 20230828202840.png]]
## Type of Bond
- $\lvert\chi(A)-\chi(B)\rvert=1.9$ ---> $50\%$ ionic, $50\%$ covalent
- $\lvert\chi(A)-\chi(B)\rvert>1.9$ ---> more ionic
- $\lvert\chi(A)-\chi(B)\rvert<1.9$ ---> more covalent
## Fajan's Rule
1. Smaller, more positive cation
	- Have high polarization power
1. Larger, more negative anion
	- Have high polarizability
 1. Pseudo-Octet electronic configuration
	- Cations with 18 electrons in outer most shell has higher polarization power
