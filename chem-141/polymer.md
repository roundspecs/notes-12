# Macromolecules
- **Definition:** A molecule containing a very large number of atoms

# Polymer
- **Greek:** many parts
- **Definition:** A high molecular weight compound formed by the combination of a large number of one or more types of molecules of  low molecular weight. 
- **Examples:** starch, rubber, protein, resins. Polyethylene, PVC

# Monomer
- **Definiton:** A molecule that can react together with other monomer molecules to form a larger polymer chain.
- **Examples:**
  | Polymer      | Monomer                 |
  | ------------ | ----------------------- |
  | Cellulose    | Glucose                 |
  | Polyethylene | Ethylene                |
  | Bakelite     | Phenol and Formaldehyde |

# Polymerization Reaction
- **Definition:** The process of combining a large number of small molecules to form a single macromolecule is known as polymerisation.
- **2 Types:** Addition and Condensation. 

## Addition Plymerization
- **Definition:** Repeated addition of monomers that possess double or triple bonds to form polymers.

## Condensation Plymerization
- **Definition:** Repeated condensation reactions between two different bi-functional or tri-functional monomers.

# Difference between Addition and Condensation reaction
| Addition Polymerisation | Condensation Polymerisation |
|-------------------------|---------|
| Monomers have a double or triple bond. | Bi-functional or tri-functional monomer |
| No by-products | By-products like $NH_3$, $H_2O$ & $HCl$ |
| Results in the addition of monomers | Monomers are condensed |
| Polymer's molecular weight is a multiple of  monomer’s molecular weight | Polymer's molecular weight is not a multiple of the monomer’s molecular weight |
| Lewis acids, Lewis bases, and radical initiators are used as catalysts. | Different molecules are used as catalysts |
| Examples: Polyethylene, Teflon, and PVC | Examples: Bakelite, Nylon and Silicon |

# Repeating Unit
- **Definiton:** Part of  a polymer which can form a polymer chain by repeating themselves and linking together successively along the chain. 
- In Addition Polymerization reaction, monomer $=$ repeating unit
  - Monomer and Repeating unit of polyethylene is    $-CH_2-CH_2-$ 
- In Condensation Polymerization reaction, monomer $\neq$ repeating unit
  - Monomers of nylon-6,6 is Hexadioic acid ($HOOC-(CH_2)_4-COOH$) & 1,6-diamino hexane ($H_2N-(CH_2)_6-NH_2$)\
  Repeating unit is $[-OC-(CH_2)_4-CO-NH-(CH_2)_6-NH- ]$

# Degree of polymerization
- Number of repeating units in the polymer molecule. 
- Calculated as the ratio of molecular weight of a polymer and molecular weight of a repeating unit.
  
# Classification of Polymer
## Origin
**Natural:** Extacted from nature\
**Synthetic:** Syntesized from monomers

## Carbon chain
**Organic:** Backbone essentially made of C\
**Iorganic:** No C in backbone

## Heating effect
**Thermoplastic:** Can be melted and molded\
**Thermosetting:** Can't be

## Backbone
**Homogeneous:** All same atoms in backbone\
**Heterogeneous:** Different atoms in backbone

## Graphical structure
**Linear:** Each repeating unit is linked with two repeating units on each side
**Branch:** Mostly linear, with occasional branches
**Cross-linked:** Branches react and form criss-crossed
